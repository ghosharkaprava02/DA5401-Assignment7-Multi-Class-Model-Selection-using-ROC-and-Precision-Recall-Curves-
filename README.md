## Documentation

This repository contains my submission for **Assignment 7** of DA5401.  
The task focuses on **multi-class classification** using the **UCI Landsat Satellite dataset** with six land cover classes.

The notebook covers:  
1. **Data Preparation:** Preprocessing, feature scaling, and label encoding.  
2. **Model Training:** Implementing multiple classifiers across diverse model families.  
3. **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, weighted F1-score, macro-averaged ROC-AUC, and PRC Average Precision (AP).  
4. **Visualization:** Plotting ROC and Precision-Recall Curves for all classifiers.  
5. **Bonus Experiments:** Including RandomForest, XGBoost, and a poor classifier (AUC < 0.5).  
6. **Interpretation:** Explaining model behaviors and performance trade-offs.

This assignment demonstrates how **ROC and PRC analysis** provide a deeper understanding of model performance beyond simple accuracy in multi-class settings.
